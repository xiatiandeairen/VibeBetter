# v0.23.0 Release Notes — Snapshot Diff Comparison

Compare metrics between two time points to track project trajectory.

- `vibe diff` — Compare latest snapshot with a previous one
- `--snapshots <n>` — How many snapshots back to compare (default: 2)
- Shows delta, direction arrows, and percentage change for each metric
- Inverted display for risk metrics (lower is better)
