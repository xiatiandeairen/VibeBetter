**Category**: User
**Date**: 2026-02-26

## Changes
- Added `vibe what-if` CLI command — simulate PSRI weight changes
- Accepts per-dimension weight overrides (structural, change, defect, architecture, runtime, coverage)
- Shows current vs simulated PSRI score with delta
- Warns when weights don't sum to 1.0
